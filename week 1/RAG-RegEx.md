## Can chunking be done without an Embedding Model?
Yes it is possible.

CEO of Jina AI [Han Xiao](https://gist.github.com/hanxiao) shared a Reg-Ex which is capable of chunking documents without help of an Embedding model.
This is (aparently) also the core participle implementation in [Jina Segementer API](https://jina.ai/segmenter/).
